Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Example 1:

```c++
Input: strs = {"flower","flow","flight"}
Output: "fl"
```
### Constraints:

* 1 <= strs.length <= 200
* 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
* strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
